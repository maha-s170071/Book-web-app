## Observations

My task is to create a simple app that displays a list of books and allows users to add
new books to the list.
The app should have two screens:

1. A list screen that displays the list of books.
2. A form screen that allows the user to add a new book to the list.
   The list screen should display the title and author of each book. Each book should be
   tappable and should navigate to the detail screen when tapped.
   The form screen should have two input fields: one for the book title and one for the
   author. When the user submits the form, the app should add the new book to the list
   and navigate back to the list screen.
