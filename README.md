My task is to create a simple app that displays a list of books and allows users to add
new books to the list.
The app have following features:

1. A list screen that displays the list of books.
2. A form screen that allows the user to add a new book to the list.
   The list screen should display the title and author of each book. Each book should be
   tappable and should navigate to the detail screen when tapped.
   The form screen should have two input fields: one for the book title and one for the
   author. When the user submits the form, the app should add the new book to the list
3.This is a project which entails a booklist where a user can add and remove books. It is highly effective for someone who wants to keep track of the books they're reading or a person who     owns a library and wants to keep track of the books borrowed and those returned. I am yet to implement the full functionality of this website.
